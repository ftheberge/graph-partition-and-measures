Teams are part of 12 conferences (the 'communities'):
0 = Atlantic Coast
1 = Big East
2 = Big Ten
3 = Big Twelve
4 = Conference USA
5 = Independents
6 = Mid-American
7 = Mountain West
8 = Pacific Ten
9 = Southeastern
10 = Sun Belt
11 = Western Athletic

14 teams out of 115 appear as anomalies as can be seen in Figure 5 of [REF], namely:

5 teams in #5 conference (Independent) play teams in other conferences (green triangles)
7 teams in #10 conference (Sun Belt) are broken in 2 clumps (pink triangles)
2 teams from #11 conference play mainly with #10 conference (red triangles)

Here, we try to recover those anomalous teams by running several embeddings (we use node2vec):

for each embedding:
compute divergence using our framework
also compute entropy of b-vector for each node (probability distribution of edges w.r.t. every community in the geometric Chung-Lu model)
plot entropy vs divergence
for some good/bad embedding, boxplot entropy of anomalous vs other nodes
